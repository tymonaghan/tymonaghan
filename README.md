### Tyler Monaghan

I recently completed the immersive software engineering bootcamp at Fullstack Academy and I'm looking for a new position on a software development team that's making the world a better place!

Most of my time is spent working with: 
- JavaScript (especially Node.js)
- React
- DevOps

I'm currently learning:
- Java (on codeacademy.com)
- Tailwind CSS ([on my development portfolio site](https://github.com/tymonaghan/dev-portfolio) - in progress)
